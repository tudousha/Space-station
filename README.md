## 🎯 THE MISSION
Take control as **Cooper** in this high-fidelity recreation of the iconic docking scene from *Interstellar*. 

The Endurance station is spinning at a critical, lethal velocity. To save the mission, you must manually pilot the Ranger to match the station's **120 RPM** rotation exactly while maintaining perfect axial alignment. There is no time for caution.
